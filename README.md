This is a mod for Balatro that adds a bunch of Jokers and Boss Blinds, a few vouchers, one tag, and visual changes to the Tarot and Spectral Cards based on the Eurovision Song Contest!

# IMPORTANT INFO
As of this message, this mod is in extremely early development, I am expecting a lot of patience in getting this done, since this is my first coding related thing I've ever really done (scratch does not count (editor lewis here, it gives you fundimentals))

Due to how it works, Talisman will crash your game with some Jokers, I recommend switching to [Amulet](https://github.com/frostice482/amulet) to dodge these problems. Talisman should still work for the most part, but Amulet fixes a lot of issues.

# how one get?
I'll be making a video tutorial on how exactly to download the mod properly once it's in a complete state, for the moment though, just have Lovely and Steammodded as per, and put the files where they need to go. If you are actually interested in this mod's early development, You should know a thing or two.
